# Case-study-foodpanda
### Case study outside of my work

### Overview
Nowadays, people eat in many different ways, ranging from less convenient to more convenient options. Some people cook unprepared foods while others prefer prepared foods that are ready to eat. foodpanda has already developed solutions for three main categories of eating options.

On-demand restaurant delivery
Eating out/ ordering pickup
Online grocery delivery
Healthy packaged food consumption increases rather than that of prepared foods from restaurants and unprepared grocery foods.

In this case study, I aimed to answer whether or not foodpanda should build a new solution for a 4th way of eating: Packaged Meals to fit user needs and add business values to company.
